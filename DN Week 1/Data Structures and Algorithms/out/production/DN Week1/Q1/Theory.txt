#Why Data Structures and Algorithms are essential in handling large inventories?
- In inventory management systems, efficient data structures are crucial because:-
a. Scalability: The system must be able to handle large volumes of data efficiently as the number of products increases,
b. Peformance: Fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion of product information are necessary to maintain system performance,
c. Resource Management: Optimal usage of the memory and processor.

#Types of Data Structures that can be used:
a. ArrayList
b. HashMap
c. TreeMap
d. LinkedList

Each have their own advantages and disadvantages.

#Time Complexity:
- Add product - O(1)
- Update product - O(1)
- Delete product - O(1)
- Retrieve product - O(1)

This is because we are using a HashMap.

#Optimization:
> Load Factor and Rehashing: Ensure load factor of the HashMap is managed to minimize the number of rehashes,
> Memory Management: Periodically clean unused objects.
